            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that
            represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of
            objects. Each element, attribute, and text within the document is
            represented as a node, allowing developers to access, manipulate,
            and update the content and structure of a webpage using languages
            like JavaScript. The DOM provides a way for scripts to dynamically
            interact with the content of a document, enabling features like
            updates, animations, and interactive elements.

          <p>
            The purpose of the Document Object Model (DOM) is to provide a
            structured representation of a web document, enabling scripts and
            programming languages to interact with and manipulate the document's
            content and structure dynamically. It allows developers to create,
            modify, and delete elements, attributes, and text within the
            document, facilitating real-time updates and interactivity.
            Additionally, the DOM serves as a bridge between the webpage's HTML
            structure and the scripting languages, enhancing the user experience
            through dynamic content changes.

          What is the difference between querySelector() and getElementById()?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            The querySelector() method selects the first element that matches a
            specified CSS selector, allowing for greater flexibility in
            selecting elements by class, tag, or attribute. In contrast,
            getElementById() specifically targets an element with a unique ID,
            returning a single element directly. While querySelector() can
            return any element, getElementById() is optimized for retrieving
            elements by their ID, making it faster in that specific use case.

          Why DOM is important?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            The DOM (Document Object Model) is important because it provides a
            structured representation of the HTML document, allowing developers
            to programmatically access and manipulate the content, structure,
            and style of web pages. This dynamic interaction enables the
            creation of responsive and interactive user experiences.
            Additionally, the DOM serves as the bridge between JavaScript and
            HTML, facilitating real-time updates without needing to reload the
            entire page.
